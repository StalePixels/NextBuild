# NextBuild v7 Full Release 

NextBuild : A suite of tools based on Boriel's ZX Basic Compiler targetting the ZX Spectrum Next



Please report any bugs and I will try to fix them.

http://zxbasic.uk/nextbuild/

Latest ZXBasic Compiler included v15.1.0
Now generates NEX & bin files 
Scripts rewritten in python so will work on Win, Mac & Linux

Download the archive and extract to a folder, launch VScode
and choose "Open Folder", select the "Sources" folder inside
of \NextBuildv7 

Load a source .bas file (try examples) and then compile by
using the terminal menu and Run Build Task - you can configure
a keyboard shortcut in your prefs. 

This should compile and launch in CSpect if there is an error 
the Compile.txt is opened in the default text editor. 

See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kF_jfE7mAvg how to setup for 
Windows.
