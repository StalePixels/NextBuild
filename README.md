# NextBuild v7 Full Release 

NextBuild : A suite of tools based on Boriel's ZX Basic Compiler targetting the ZX Spectrum Next



Please report any bugs and I will try to fix them.

http://zxbasic.uk/nextbuild/

Latest ZXBasic Compiler included v15.1.0
Now generates NEX & bin files 
Scripts rewritten in python so will work on Win, Mac & Linux

**VSCode will install the NextBuild VSCode extension**

Download the archive and extract to a folder, launch VScode
and choose "Open Folder", select the "Sources" folder inside
of \NextBuildv7 

Load a source .bas file (try examples) and then compile by
using the terminal menu and Run Build Task - you can configure
a keyboard shortcut in your prefs. 

This should compile and launch in CSpect if there is an error 
the Compile.txt is opened in the default text editor. 

See the video below on how to setup for Windows & VSCode
